# NP-SAM

## Introduction
Find the full repository at [GitLab](https://gitlab.au.dk/disorder/np-sam/-/tree/main/).

In this project we propose an easily implementable workflow for a fast, accurate and seamless experience of segmentation of nanoparticles.

The project's experience could be significantly enhanced with the presence of a CUDA-compatible device; alternatively, Google Colab can be utilized if such a device is not accessible. For a quick access to the program and a CUDA-GPU try our Google Colab notebook. <br>
